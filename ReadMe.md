## Orbweb Connectivity Suite™ (OCS)
OCS provides an end-to-end connectivity solution for any number of devices that is secure and easy to use. This is accomplished through the use of established NAT traversal techniques and Orbweb's proprietary algorithms which enable devices to “punch” a hole through the firewall to reach the peer they wish to communicate with, thus creating a communication link. This technique enables 99% connectivity rates, while enabling high-speed bi-directional data transfers between peers with a secured AES-128 bit end-to-end encryption. No matter how many NATs or firewalls there are between peers, Orbweb's connectivity solution will be able to connect any number of devices anywhere in the world.
